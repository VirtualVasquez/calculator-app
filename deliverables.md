1. Type Annotations:

- ~~Add type annotations to variables and function parameters.~~
- ~~Ensure functions have clear return type declarations.~~

2. Interfaces and Type Declarations:

 - Define interfaces for complex object shapes used in the project.
 - Create type aliases for commonly used types.

3. Generics and Advanced Types:
 - Implement generics for reusable components.
 - Explore and apply advanced TypeScript features (e.g., mapped types, conditional types) where applicable.

4. Union and Intersection Types:
 - ~~Use union types where multiple types are possible.~~
 - Utilize intersection types when combining different types.

5. Function Overloading and Signatures:

 - Handle different function call patterns by using function overloading and signatures.

6. Strict Mode and Compiler Options:

 - ~~Enable TypeScript's strict mode and set appropriate compiler options to catch errors early.~~

7. Module Systems and Typings:

 - Organize code using TypeScript's module system (import/export).
 - Manage typings for external libraries or create custom typings.

8. Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript:

 - ~~Convert existing JavaScript files to TypeScript.~~
 - Resolve compilation errors during conversion.

9. Error Handling and Debugging:

- ~~Handle type-related errors effectively.~~
- Debug and troubleshoot TypeScript-specific issues.

10. IDE/Editor Integration:

 - ~~Configure your IDE/editor to maximize TypeScript features (e.g., autocompletion, type checking).~~

11. Documentation and Comments:

 - ~~Add clear comments and type annotations within the codebase.~~

12. Testing with TypeScript:

- Write and maintain tests using TypeScript-compatible testing frameworks.
- Ensure type safety in test suites.

13. CI/CD Integration:

- Integrate TypeScript projects into CI/CD pipelines for smooth integration and deployment.
