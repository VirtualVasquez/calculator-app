1. Type Annotations:

- Add type annotations to variables and function parameters.
- Ensure functions have clear return type declarations.

Interfaces and Type Declarations:

Define interfaces for complex object shapes used in the project.
Create type aliases for commonly used types.
Generics and Advanced Types:

Implement generics for reusable components.
Explore and apply advanced TypeScript features (e.g., mapped types, conditional types) where applicable.
Union and Intersection Types:

Use union types where multiple types are possible.
Utilize intersection types when combining different types.
Function Overloading and Signatures:

Handle different function call patterns by using function overloading and signatures.
Strict Mode and Compiler Options:

Enable TypeScript's strict mode and set appropriate compiler options to catch errors early.
Module Systems and Typings:

Organize code using TypeScript's module system (import/export).
Manage typings for external libraries or create custom typings.
Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript:

Convert existing JavaScript files to TypeScript.
Resolve compilation errors during conversion.
Error Handling and Debugging:

Handle type-related errors effectively.
Debug and troubleshoot TypeScript-specific issues.
IDE/Editor Integration:

Configure your IDE/editor to maximize TypeScript features (e.g., autocompletion, type checking).
Documentation and Comments:

Add clear comments and type annotations within the codebase.
Testing with TypeScript:

Write and maintain tests using TypeScript-compatible testing frameworks.
Ensure type safety in test suites.
CI/CD Integration:

Integrate TypeScript projects into CI/CD pipelines for smooth integration and deployment.
